      <h3>After spending most of my career in auto sales, I decided to pivot to software engineering. I wanted to do something I was passionate about and when the opportunity to arose to learn something new and change careers, I jumped on it! I decided to attend General Assembly and enrolled in a 12 week immersive software engineering boot camp. While in the boot camp I learned a lot about myself. I learned that I am extremely adaptable and can learn on the fly in a fast paced environment. I also learned a multitude of problem solving skill which helped me excel in my courses.</h3>
